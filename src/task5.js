//Happy ticket
//There are 2 ways to count lucky tickets:
//1. Simple - if a six - digit number is printed on the ticket, and the sum of the first three digits is equal
//to the sum of the last three, then this ticket is considered lucky.
//2. Hard - if the sum of the even digits of the ticket is equal to the sum of the odd digits of the ticket,
//    then the ticket is considered lucky.
//Determine programmatically which variant of counting lucky tickets will give them a greater number at a given interval.

//Input parameters: context object with min and max fields
//Output: an object with information about the winning method and the number of lucky tickets for each counting method.
